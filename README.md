## Description

Due to insufficient user input validation for the "user" parameter, a serious SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the login function of the "Online Blood Bank Management System" in PHP", allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information without logging in. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.
